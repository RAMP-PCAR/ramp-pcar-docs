# Roadmap {#wb-cont}

The goal of the RAMP technical roadmap is to provide a glimpse of what is planned for the future of RAMP from both a short and long term perspective. 

By providing this information, we hope to provide some predictability on where RAMP will focus its development efforts and provide context to help elicit feedback and suggestions from users of RAMP.

## Short Term

The short term technical goals for RAMP are organized into planned releases that have already been assigned a product name, as well as have a high level scope defined.
